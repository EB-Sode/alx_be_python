# Create a Python script named book_class.py. In this script, define a Book class that uses specific magic methods to enhance its functionality. 
# This class will model a book with attributes for the title, author, and publication year.

# Requirements for Book Class in book_class.py:
# Attributes:

# title (str): The title of the book.
# author (str): The author of the book.
# year (int): The publication year of the book.
# Magic Methods:

# Constructor (__init__): Initializes a Book instance with title, author, and year.
# Destructor (__del__): Prints "Deleting (title of the book)" upon object deletion.
# String Representation (__str__): Returns a string in the format "(title) by (author), published in (year)".
# Official Representation (__repr__): Returns a string that would recreate the Book instance: f"Book('{self.title}', '{self.author}', {self.year})".

class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, publication_year: int):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.year = publication_year

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.title} by {self.author}, published in {self.year}'
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Book('{self.title}', '{self.author}', {self.year})"
    
    def __del__(self):
        print(f"Deleting {self.title}")
